# DungeonTools
A small Elvui-like window with some dungeon-functionality.

You'll see a listing of your current party shown as icons.
If a readycheck is initialized, the grey icon will first turn yellow and after clicking the "Ready" button it'll turn green.
If somebody doesnt react, you can click on the icon to send a message. (if your name is mentioned ingame you get a message)

You can start a pulltimer without beeing the leader of the group.
